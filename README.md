# Kentico Kontent React App

This is a react app that uses the [Kentico Kontent API](https://docs.kontent.ai/) to pull a list of cafe's and display them in a 'card style' list using [material-ui](https://material-ui.com/).

I find the card style is a great way to illustrate lists of items (e.g. a list of company locations) in a neat format whilst still including lots of information at the same time.

The 'client api' was written in typescript and I would encourage anyone pulling data from the Kentico Kontent API to do the same, even at the very least for the intelliSense.

## To Run the App

To run the app just execute the following commands below:

```console
> git clone https://github.com/brandoncaulfield/kentico-kontent-react-app

> cd kentico-kontent-react-app

> npm install

> npm start
```
